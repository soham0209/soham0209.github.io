      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

Hi, after graduating with a PhD in CS from Purdue University, I joined Cadence Design Systems as a Lead Software Engineer. My thesis titled "Unveiling patterns in data: harnessing computational topology in machine learning" is avalilable [here](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/Unveiling_patterns_in_data_harnessing_computational_topology_in_machine_learning/25114625/1/files/44320463.pdf) I moved to Purdue (Fall 2020) from The Ohio State University along with my advisor [Prof. Tamal Krishna Dey](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/tamaldey/). I am in CTDA group of Purdue CS dept. I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Tele-communication Engineering from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in), Kolkata. My undergraduate research was in Circuits and Systems in ADESL lab under [Prof. Mrinal Kanti Naskar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t5kOc_EAAAAJ&hl=en). I am from the city of joy, Kolkata, situated in easteern part of India. Apart from doing nerdy stuff(Nerds call it research),I sometimes pick up my good old camera to click some photos.
